# straightforward look at making a Fibonacci sequence to reach the nth number
# in the sequence. Upon starting with two variables with value 1, the script
# renders the first variable (a) equal to b , and the second variable, (b) equal
# to a+b. It then adds b to the list of variables and reruns this loop until it
# reaches the nth iteration.
