# Elementary-Codes
Basic coding exercises for demonstration. 

The individual projects here are less for a cohesive project and more as a demonstration of and/or practice regarding basic coding concepts.

Ultimately this will be intended to show a basic understanding of concepts such as recursion, navigating data structures, and slightly 
more advanced sorting algoriths such as merge sort. 

Other small projects , such as binary addition using only boolean operators, may be uploaded here just for fun.
